# Belly Button Challenge

## Step 1
- I used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

## Step 2
- I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual
- I use sample_values as the values for the bar chart, otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart and otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart

## Step 3
- I created a bubble chart that displays each sample
- I used otu_ids for the x values, sample_values for the y values, sample_values for the marker size, otu_ids for the marker colors and otu_labels for the text values

## Step 4
- I displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information
- I ensured all plots updated when a new sample was selected on the dashboard

## Step 5
- I deployed my app to GitHub Pages
